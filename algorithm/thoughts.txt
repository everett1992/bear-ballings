Main with heuristics

list of list of buckets
[ [[A B C][D E F]] [[A B][D G]] ... ]
list of fulfilled classes (from user's perspective)
[ [] [] ... ]
list of priorities (credits)
[ 12 4 ... ]
list of courses (id, day, ST, ET)

class has time, day, maximum

DO:

(Max of 4 times - no overload)
- Go through people (if no more classes to take, add blank?)
- Randomly pick people with the following (Highest Priority, Lowest amount of fulfilled classes)
- Assuming they can still take a class, try to put them in things, working down through the buckets
- If there is a match (still open, no time contradictions OR there is no requirement), recurse, doing the following:
	- remove bucket from user's list
	- add class to user's list
	- IF no requirement, place them in the emptiest class (or maybe the one with the least preferences)
- Else, back up
